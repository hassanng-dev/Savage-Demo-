In this project you are able to send out a message to a thread and users are able to vote thumbs up or thumbs down whether or not they like to content being displayed. This follows a similar pattern to a reddit post whether the commnunity can interact with the published post.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. I needed Javascript to have the ability to interact with the thumbs icon to display the number of interactions of that particular post made. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I recongized that there were many times when I would go grocery shopping with just a mental list. After awhile I would forget an item or two and would have to make a second trip back.


LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
